Metallica the Unforgiven II Part 1

[Verse 1]
Lay beside me
And tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear
To make my demons run
The door is locked now
But it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me
Then I can understand the you

[Verse 2]
Lay beside me
Under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze
The door cracks open
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still
But there's no sun shining through

[Pre-Chorus]
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

Metallica the Unforgiven II Part 2

[Verse 3]
Come lay beside me
This won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still
But she'll never love again
She lay beside me
But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead-sure, she'll be there

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Lay beside me
Tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you, oh
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
(So I dub thee Unforgiven)
Oh-oh, What I've felt
Oh, what I've known
I take this key (Never free) and I bury it (Never me) in you
Because you're unforgiven, too
[Outro]
(Never free, never me)
Because you're unforgiven, too
Oh, oh, oh
